**Problem Statement**

 Designing a device that will help visually challenged people or people in such situations where vision can&#39;t help further, to recieve information about their surrounding that they are missing on.

**Our take on the problem**

We looked up the existing solutions and what we found was that most of them use hearing aids that needs to be plugged in the ears 24x7. Since after eyes, ears are the most important sense organ in terms of recieving information, using hearing aids can cause interference with the ambient sounds.                                                                                                                                                                                     To eliminate this problem we&#39;re using skin as the sense organ to recieve data.                                              As skin is the largest sense organ, it has a vast potential to be used to gather information and this potential is rarely harnessed. In our project we&#39;re using vibration motors whose different patterns of vibrating can be morphed into a language to transmit information through skin.

**Inspiration**

We got the ispiration for this idea from research of David M. Eagleman in the field of &quot;Umvelt&quot;.

**Working Mechanism**

We have integrated ultarsonic proximity sensors to a jacket which will detect any obsatcle in the front, back, left or right of the wearer. Also, we&#39;ve a pair of shoes with infrared proximity sensors attached to them in the sole ant in the front to detect obstacles in two planes i.e. the ground level and in front of the feet. This is especially useful in the case of the wearer using stairs.                                                                                                                                                                                                        To transmit all this information we&#39;ve designed a belt and anklets with a series of vibration motors on them. The pattern of vibration is dependent on the position of the obstacles. This pattern is actually analogous to language which will be recieved by the skin and will be deciphered by the subconscious mind without requiring the user to divert their attention.

**Field of Application**

- Visually challenged people:  To aid their day to day life without compromising on the ambient sounds. Has a vast capacity to minimize accidents.
- Drone pilots:  Since most of the information is displayed on a screen they have to divide their attention to access different information. With this device more amount of information can be accessed simutaneously without dividing the attention span.
- Deep sea divers/ miners: Most of the time their working environment lacks availability of light. This device will help them being aware of the obstacles and potential sources of accidents.
- And many more...

**Technology used**

- Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
- Ultrasonic proximity sensors
- Infrared proximity sensors
- Vibration motors

**Modifications**

We&#39;re going to integrate IR camera with our project to detect fire or any hot object to prevent accidents. Also, accelerometers will be integrated. We can use AI to detect movements and identify objects. And many more modifications to make the device even better.
